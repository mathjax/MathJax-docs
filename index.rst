MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX,
MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers,
with built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers.

Version 3.0 of MathJax is a complete rewrite of MathJax from the
ground up, and its usage and configuration is significantly different
from that of MathJax version 2.  Use the green menu at the bottom of
the sidebar on the left to access the version 2 documentation if you
need it.
