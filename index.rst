MathJax Documentation
#####################

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML,
and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers, with
built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers,
including automatic speech generation and an expression explorer that
can be used to investigate typeset mathematics on a more granual level
than the complete expression.

Version 4.0 of MathJax adds significant new features to MathJax,
including support for selecting one of a number of different fonts to
use for mathematical typesetting, for in-line and displayed equation
line breaking, and for HTML within MathML and LaTeX expressions.  See
the :ref:`whats-new-in-mathjax` section for more details.  MathJax was
rewritten from the ground up in v3.0, and the usage and configuration
in v4 (and v3) is significantly different from that of MathJax v2.

documentation if you need it.
