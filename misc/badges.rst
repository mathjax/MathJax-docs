MathJax Badges
##############

We are proud of the work we have done on MathJax, and we hope you are
proud to use it. If you would like to show your support for the MathJax
project, please consider including one of our "Powered by MathJax" web
badges on your pages that use it.

Rules
=====

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of excellence for
MathJax, and part of that is avoiding confusion and misleading
impressions; therefore, if you do use our badge or logo, we ask that you
observe these simple rules (for the fine print, see below):

Things You Can Do
-----------------

-  Use the MathJax Logo or Badges in marketing, and other publicity
   materials related to MathJax.
-  Distribute unchanged MathJax products (code, development tools,
   documentation) as long as you distribute them without charge.
-  Describe your own software as "based on MathJax technology", or
   "incorporating MathJax source code" if your software includes
   modified MathJax products.
-  Link to MathJax’s website(s) by using the logos and badges we
   provide.
-  Use MathJax's word marks in describing and advertising your services
   or products relating to a MathJax product, so long as you don't do
   anything that might mislead customers. For example, it's OK if your
   website says, "Customization services for MathJax available here".
-  Make t-shirts, desktop wallpaper, or baseball caps though only for
   yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don't receive
   anything of value in return).

Things You Cannot Do
--------------------

-  Alter our logo or badges in any way.
-  Use our logo or badge online without including the link to the
   MathJax home page.
-  Place our logo or badges in such close proximity to other content
   that it is indistinguishable.
-  Make our logo or badges the most distinctive or prominent feature on
   your website, printed material or other content.
-  Use our logo or badges in a way that suggests any type of association
   or partnership with MathJax or approval, sponsorship or endorsement
   by MathJax (unless allowed via a license from us).
-  Use our logo or badges in a way that is harmful, deceptive, obscene
   or otherwise objectionable to the average person.
-  Use our logo or badges on websites or other places containing content
   associated with hate speech, pornography, gambling or illegal
   activities.
-  Use our logo or badges in, or in connection with, content that
   disparages us or sullies our reputation.


And now the fine print:
-----------------------

*The words and logotype "MathJax," the MathJax badges, and any
combination of the foregoing, whether integrated into a larger whole or
standing alone, are MathJax’s trademarks. You are authorized to use our
trademarks under the terms and conditions above, and only on the further
condition that you download the trademarks directly from our website.
MathJax retains full, unfettered, and sole discretion to revoke this
