Accessibility Components
########################

Currently, there are three components designed specifically to support
assistive technology.

* :ref:`semantic-enrich-component`
* :ref:`explorer-component`
* :ref:`complexity-component`
* :ref:`assistive-mml-component`

To load one of these components, include the component name in the
:attr:`load` array of the :attr:`loader` block of your MathJax
configuration.  For example:

.. code-block:: html

   <script>
   MathJax = {
     loader: {
       load: ['a11y/semantic-enrich']
     }
   }
   </script>

to load the `semantic-enrich` extension.

The `semantic-enrich` and `explorer` components are part of all the
:ref:`combined components <combined-components>`, so if you are using
one of the those, you don't need to load these assistive extensions
yourself.


.. note::

   The `auto-collapse` extension from version 2 has not yet been
   converted to the current version of MathJax, but will be in a
   future release.

.. note::

   The `assistive-menu` extension from version 2 is now part of the
   standard :ref:`contextual menu extension <menu-component>`, so
   doesn't have to be loaded separately.

.. _semantic-enrich-component:

a11y/semantic-enrich
====================

The `semantic-enrich` component connects MathJax with the `Speech
Rule Engine <https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine>`_, which
allows MathJax to generate speech strings for the mathematics that it
processes.  These can be attached to the output for use by screen
readers, or for use with the :ref:`explorer-component` component
described below.

See the :ref:`semantic-enrich-options` section for information about
configuring this component.

-----


.. _explorer-component:

a11y/explorer
=============

The `explorer` component allows readers to explore a mathematical
expression interactively.  When an expression is focused by tabbing to
it, a reader can "enter" the expression by pressing shift-space on the
keyboard.  Clicking on a typeset expression will also enter the
explorer at the character that is clicked.

Once the explorer is activated, the arrow keys move the reader through
the expression: down moves to more detail by selecting the first
subexpression of the selected expression, up moves to more complete
expressions, while left and right move through the sub-expressions at
the current level.  See the :ref:`accessibility` section for more
details about using the expression explorer and its various features.

See the :ref:`explorer-options` section for information about
configuring this component.

-----


.. _complexity-component:

a11y/complexity
===============

The `complexity` component computes a complexity measure for each
element within an expression, and allows complex expressions to
"collapse" to make them both shorter, and simpler to read.  The
collapsed portions can be expanded with a click of the mouse, or by
keyboard actions when using the :ref:`explorer-component` extension
described above.

See the :ref:`complexity-options` section for information about
configuring this component.

-----


.. _assistive-mml-component:

a11y/assistive-mml
==================

The `assistive-mml` component embeds visually hidden MathML alongside
MathJax's visual rendering while hiding the visual rendering from
assistive technology (AT) such as screenreaders. This allows most
MathML-enabled screenreaders to read out the underlying
mathematics. It's important to note that Presentation MathML is
usually not expressive enough to voice the mathematics properly in all
circumstances, which is why screenreaders have to rely on heuristics
to analyze the MathML semantically.  See the
:ref:`screenreader-support` section for more details about screen
reader support via the `assistive-mml` extension.

See the :ref:`assistive-mml-options` section for information about
configuring this component.
