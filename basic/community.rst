The MathJax Community
#####################

If you are an active MathJax user, you may wish to become involved in
the wider community of MathJax users.  The MathJax project maintains
forums where users can ask questions about how to use MathJax, make
suggestions about future features for MathJax, and present their own
solutions to problems that they have faced.  There is also a
bug-tracking system where you can report errors that you have found
with MathJax in your environment.


.. _community-forums:

Mailing Lists
=============

If you need help using MathJax or you have solutions you want to
share, please post to the `MathJax Users Google Group
<https://groups.google.com/g/mathjax-users>`__. We try hard to answer
questions quickly, and users are welcome to help with that as
well. Also, users can post code snippets showing how they have used
MathJax, so it may be a good place to find the examples you are
looking for.

If you want to discuss MathJax development, please use the `MathJax
Dev Google Group <https://groups.google.com/g/mathjax-dev>`_. We made
this group to discuss anything beyond what an end-user might be
interested in, so if you have any suggestions or questions about
MathJax performance, technology, or design, feel free to submit it to
the group.

The community is only as good as the users who participate, so if you
have something to offer, please take time to make a post on one of our
groups.


.. _community-tracker:

Issue tracking
==============

Found a bug or want to suggest an improvement? Post it to our `issue
tracker <http://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues>`_. We monitor the
tracker closely, and work hard to respond to problems quickly.

Before you create a new issue, however, please search the issues to
see if it has already been reported. You could also be using an
outdated version of MathJax, so be sure to :ref:`upgrade your copy
<mathjax-git>` to verify that the problem persists in the
latest version.

When y9ou create an issue, you will need to choose between a bug
report and a feature request.  Each of these comes with a template
that you should use to structure your report or request.  **Do not
just erase that template**, as the information that it requests is
important for us to be able to analyze your issue and give you an
answer.  See the section on :ref:`Reporting Issues <reporting-issues>`
for more detailed instructions.
