Reporting Issues
################

If you come across a problem with MathJax, please report it so that the
development team and other users are aware and can look into it. It is
important that you report your problem following the steps outlined here
because this will help us to rapidly establish the nature of the problem
and work towards a solution effectively.

To report a problem, please follow these steps:

-  Have you cleared your browser cache, quit your browser, and restarted
   it? If not, please do so first and check if the problem persists.
   `These instructions <http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache>`__
   tell you how to clear your cache on the major browsers.
   
-  Have you turned off other extensions and plugins in your browser, and
   restarted it?
   
-  Have a look at the math rendering examples on
   `www.mathjax.org <https://www.mathjax.org>`__ to see if you experience
   problems there as well. This might help you to determine the nature
   of your problem.
   
-  If possible, check whether the problem has been solved in the latest
   MathJax release.
   
-  Search through the `MathJax User
   Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mathjax-users>`__ and the
   `MathJax issue tracker <https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues>`__ to see if
   anyone else has come across the problem before.
   
-  Found a real and new problem? Please report it to the `MathJax issue
   tracker <https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues>`__ by filling
   out the issue template.  **Do not just erase the template** and
   write a free-form report.  The information requested in the
   template may be crucial to diagnosing your problem, and without it,
   we may not be able to give you a meaningful response.  Be sure to
   include the following information:

   -  A detailed description of the problem. What exactly is not working
      as you expected? What do you see?
      
   -  The MathJax version you are working with, your operating system,
      and full browser information including all version information.

   -  The MathJax configuration you are using, and the MathJax
      component you are loading (e.g., :file:`tex-chtml.js`).

   -  If a particular expression is not displaying properly, then please
      include the original LaTeX, MathML, or AsciiMath version of the
      expression as text (that can be copied), as well as a screen
      snapshot of the result you are seeing in your browser.

   -  If you are making calls to the MathJax API, how and when are you
      doing so?  It would help to include a code snippet with the
      actual calls you are making.  Because the timing of such calls
      is often at issue, the surrounding code may also be important to
      include.
      
   -  If at all possible, a pointer to a webpage that is publicly
      available and exhibits the problem. This makes sure that we can
      reproduce the problem and test possible solutions.  You can
      create minimal examples using such tools as `jsfiddle
      <https://jsfiddle.net/>`__, `jsbin <https://jsbin.com>`__,
      `codepen <https://codepen.io>`__, or `codesandbox
      <https://codesandbox.io>`__.
