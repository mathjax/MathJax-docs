The `noerrors` extension prevents TeX error messages from being
displayed and shows the original TeX code instead.

.. note::
   
   In version 2 of MathJax, you could configure the CSS that
   applied to the display of the original TeX.  In version 3, the
   original TeX is shown via an `merror` MathML element instead.

.. note::
   
   In version 2, this extension was included in all the combined
   configuration files that contain the TeX input jax, but in MathJax
   version 3 and above, you must load it explicitly if you want to use
   it.

To load the `noerrors` extension, add ``'[tex]/noerrors'`` to the
:data:`load` array of the :data:`loader` block of your MathJax
configuration, and add ``'noerrors'`` to the :data:`packages` array of
the :data:`tex` block.

.. code-block:: javascript

   window.MathJax = {
     loader: {load: ['[tex]/noerrors']},
     tex: {packages: {'[+]': ['noerrors']}}
   };
