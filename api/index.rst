The MathJax API
===============

The following links document the various components that make up
MathJax.  These are implemented as JavaScript objects contained within
the single global variable, ``MathJax``.  Although JavaScript includes
an object system with some inheritance capabilities, they do not
constitute a full object-oriented programming model, so MathJax
implements its own object library.  This means there is an ambiguity
when we speak of an "object", as it could be either a native
JavaScript object, or a MathJax object.  When the distinction is
important, we will use `Object` (capitalized) or `MathJax.Object` for
the latter; the javascript object will always be listed in lower
case.
